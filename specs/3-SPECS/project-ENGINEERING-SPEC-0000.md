<!--
Engineering Specifications inform developers about the exact shape of
the way the piece of software was built, using paradigms relevant to the
programming language that this project has been built with. The document
seeks to describe in exacting detail "how it works". It describes a
specific implementation of a logical design.

In some cases there may not be a separate logical specification, so the
Implementation Specification documents the design of a reference
implementation that satisfies the requirements set out in the
Behavioral and Structural Requirements Specifications.
