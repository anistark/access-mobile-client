<!--
A Requirements Specification informs stakeholders and external parties about the code
and infrastructure; "what it does and why it does it".

The language in which this document is framed shall be the language of the intended
user of the product (NOT the user of the spec to design the product, but the
business language of the end user). This is important in that in some cases, that
end user is themselves a developer, so some technical language is expected but NO
language committing the implementer to one or another design with which to meet
these requirements.

Guidelines for Requirements:
----------------------------
- Requirements shall be formal
- Requirements shall be stated in natural language
- Requirements shall not include or presume any details of any implementation
- Requirements shall be implementable
- Requirements shall be testable
- Requirements shall be discrete (defining a single, atomic thing that the desired application is to do)
- Requirements shall be uniquely identified
- Requirements shall be subject to formal change control

## Job story examples
[jobstories]: #jobstories

## Important Testing Verifications
[testing]: #testing

<!--
In many cases, spec-compliant implementations will do well to have a list of
important tests that should be run (unit, integration, e2e, smoke, etc.) This is
where such tests should be clearly explained and required - if necessary.
